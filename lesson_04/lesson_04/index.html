    <p class="main">What you need to know about combs?</p>
    <p class="text">
      Keeping your crowning glory looking its finest requires the correct type
      of hairbrush. With so many options available, selecting the right one can
      be confusing. A hairbrush for routine brushing should be selected based on
      the texture and length of your hair.</p>

      <p class="text">There are also specific brushes that can be used when styling hair.
      Knowing what options are available will narrow your search when shopping
      for your next hairbrush.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="text">Hairbrushes are available in a variety of designs. The bristles on each
      type of brush differ in their arrangement, length, stiffness, number, and
      the materials from which they are made. Hairbrush bristles can be
      synthetic, boar bristle, metal, or wooden.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="text">Knowing your hair type and any specific needs are the most important
      factors when choosing a hairbrush. Specific hair conditions like thinning
      hair or extremely damaged hair may need special care. Selecting a brush
      that will not only order the hair but also gently stimulate the scalp is
      essential.</p>
      <br>
      <p class="text">Many of us remember our mothers dragging a brush painfully through our
      manes before school when we were kids. Fortunately, new materials and
      designs are now available that is gentle enough even for a baby’s fine
      hair.</p>

        <span>A wet hairbrush is specifically for use on wet hair. It often has the same features as a detangling brush which is used as a wet brush. The bristles are flexible and soft so that hair is gently unknotted while it massages the scalp. During swimming or washing, long hair often becomes more tangled than usual. While it is wet, hair is more prone to damage or breakage, so it is essential to use a fine and soft hairbrush that won’t rip out clumps when it encounters a tangle. Wet brushes are designed so that they will remain gentle even if you accidentally brush a little too hard.</span>
